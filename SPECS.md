# Network Threat Detection and Defense System

## Overview

As the complexity of cyber threats continues to evolve, network security has become a crucial component in safeguarding digital systems. This project aims to develop an intelligent system for detecting and defending against network threats using a combination of relational and NoSQL databases, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques. The system will focus on automating threat detection and defense using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and simulating DDoS propagation.

## Key Features

- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Collect and analyze network data to detect anomalies and potential attacks.
- **Threat Detection**: Use machine learning model - DQN for identifying patterns of malicious activities like DDoS attacks.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Defense**: RL agent dynamically adapts defense strategies, such as blocking IP addresses or adjusting firewall rules.
- **Data Storage**: Utilize both relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases to store simulated network traffic logs.
- **Malware Simulation**: Simulate malware propagation across the network and develop methods to stop its spread.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Visualize network traffic, threats, and the actions taken by the RL agent.

## Technical Aspects

### 1. Data Collection and Storage

- **Simulated Network Traffic Capture**: Simulate network traffic and log metadata (e.g., IP addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps) for testing and analysis.
- **Relational Database**: Neo4j will store simulated user session data and user activity logs.
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB will store simulated network traffic records and attack patterns.

### 2. Threat Detection and Analysis

- **Machine Learning Models**: Use DQN to detect anomalies and potential attacks in simulated network traffic.
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Analyze patterns in network traffic using advanced models to detect phishing and social engineering attacks.
- **Graph-Based Anomaly Detection**: Represent the simulated network as a graph, where nodes represent devices/IPs, and edges represent connections. This will help detect abnormal relationships indicative of a threat.

### 3. Malware Simulation and Spread Analysis

- **Graph Analysis**: Model malware spread by analyzing the network topology and identifying key points of vulnerability in the simulated environment.
- **Tools**: NetworkX (for graph modeling)
- **Mitigation**: Develop methods to halt malware spread by identifying weak spots and enhancing security measures.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning for Automated Defense

- **Environment**: Simulate network traffic and attacks using a controlled environment (e.g., OpenAI Gym or custom simulator).
- **States**: The system's state represents the network traffic features, such as packet counts, protocols, and detected anomalies.
- **Actions**: Actions include blocking an IP address, activating firewall rules, and generating alerts.
- **Reward System**: The agent is rewarded for correctly identifying and mitigating attacks (e.g., blocking malicious traffic) and penalized for false positives (e.g., blocking legitimate traffic).

### 5. User Interface and Dashboard

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Display real-time network traffic, detected threats, and the actions taken by the RL agent on a dashboard.

### 6. Network Analysis Components

#### 1. **Basic Graph Theory Applications**
   - **Vulnerability Graphs**: Model network vulnerabilities and their relationships as directed graphs, where nodes represent vulnerabilities and edges represent the connections or dependencies between them. This will help to visualize how vulnerabilities are connected across the network.
   - **Attack Path Analysis**: Use basic graph traversal techniques to identify potential attack paths between compromised nodes. This analysis can help understand how a malicious actor could navigate through the network once an entry point is established.
   - **Centrality Metrics**: Calculate basic centrality metrics (such as degree centrality and closeness centrality) to identify the most critical vulnerabilities in the network. These could be key points where the attack could have the largest impact.

#### 2. **Advanced Graph Theory Applications** *(Optional)*
   - **Vulnerability Graphs**: Extend basic vulnerability graph models by adding more advanced features, such as incorporating metadata about the vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE data, exploitability, patch status) to improve the accuracy of the analysis.
   - **Attack Path Analysis**: Implement more sophisticated graph traversal algorithms, such as Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford, to identify the shortest or most effective attack paths in the network.
   - **Centrality Metrics**: Extend centrality metrics to include **betweenness centrality**, which measures the influence of a node over the spread of information in the network (critical for identifying attack chokepoints).
   - **Community Detection**: Use clustering or community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain or Girvan-Newman algorithms) to detect groups of related vulnerabilities or attack paths. This can help in identifying areas of the network that are most susceptible to coordinated attacks.
   - **Advanced Attack Path Analysis**: Implement more complex pathfinding algorithms to analyze different attack paths and their potential impact on network security, helping to identify weak spots for mitigation.
